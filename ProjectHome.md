Those who program often know that there are a lot of programming tasks that come up time and time again. Following the OO programming paradigm, I have compiled a small Java library with the tasks that I most often encounter, and with others that don't come up too often, but that I don't want to go through programming again doing so once. The library has been very useful in many projects in the last few years, and hopefully it can be useful to others.

I dubbed the library Programming, strangely enough, and then added a 5 after I upgraded many of the classes with features from Java 5.0 (or 1.5.0). It contains many basic classes for arrays and collections (for me, the most useful), i/o, and networking, among other things. I have tried to follow the java package name convention for grouping the classes.
